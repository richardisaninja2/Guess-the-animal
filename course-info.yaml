summary: "<p>Artificial intelligence is not just a smart system: it's a smart system\
  \ capable of self-learning. In this project, you will create a simple interactive\
  \ game where the computer will try to guess the animal that the\_person has in mind\
  \ with the help of yes or no questions. During the game, the computer will extend\_\
  its knowledge base\_by learning new facts about\_animals and using this information\_\
  in the next game.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/132?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
